# Corona-Time
Corona Virus (Covid-19) Cases tracker.
You can check iy out by going to corona-lb.web.app


I build this web app using a API found in rapidapi.com.
This app "gets" the information from the API, and splits it into the different countries available.
It shos the number of cases, deaths, recovered...

I also added an IP Tracker, that uses the IP location of the user to determine his/hers location, and display the stats for that country.
I also included a Dark Mode :).
